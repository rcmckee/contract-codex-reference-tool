Tolling and suspension of the limitations period will continue until: (i) the parties resolve the dispute as evidenced by a written settlement agreement or (ii) 45 calendar days after a binding arbitration decision is rendered, whichever is earlier.

Such limitations period shall recommence 45 days thereafter, unless within such 45-day period the receiving party delivers an ADR Notice to the other party, in which event the limitations period shall be tolled and suspended as set forth above."}
